# Linux Setup

These are my notes from installing Linux Mint 22 on my laptop.

## Previous Linux Systems

For over a decade, I have mostly used Arch and Debian-based distros for my primary OS.

At work, I was given a Windows laptop (Linux laptops before that), and I found that
WSL with Debian and the Windows Terminal app worked pretty well. I had my favorite CLI utils,
VS&nbsp;Code was nicely integrated, and file-system access between systems was very easy.

At home, it's usually Arch on PC, and Ubuntu or Debian on anything else.

## This Linux System

This time, I'm starting with a relatively full-featured distro. Linux Mint 22
is based on the latest Ubuntu LTS (24.04.1).

## Why Mint?

This is for a laptop that I could take with me to new environments.
I'd rather not troubleshoot WiFi, printing, remote file systems, etc.,
which could possibly waste another person's time.

Mint handles the boring things:
Printing is unusually painless with this distro. It also ships without
Ubuntu Snaps, which I'd rather not try to remove myself.

That only applies to laptops, though. For Workstations and VMs, I'd
rather build up my OS from a minimal base.

## During Install

The install is simple enough that I don't have any tips, but I do have
some thoughts on the file system setup.

- Full disk encryption only helps if the laptop is off.
- I can still use gpg or ccrypt on sensitive files.
- It would be nice if BTRFS was an option
  - I would love to see that and checkboxes for subvols
    - `/home`, `/.snapshots`, `/mnt`, `/run`, `/tmp`, `/var`
    - `/swap`, but this could be a separate option (file or partition, how big)
  - BTRFS would be nice for 2 reasons:
    - Timeshift snapshots will be instant
    - More subvols creates more granularity when choosing what to snapshot
  - However, I did find that Timeshift using rsync is fast enough for me
    - It also has good default exclusions in rsync mode

## Packages

Linux Mint comes with many packages out of the box, but here are some that
I typically want to `apt install`:

- `htop`
- `dos2unix`
- `git`
- `fd-find`, `ripgrep`, `fzf`
- `python3-venv`
- `rustup` for rust, cargo, etc.
- `unrar`
- some GUI tools
  - `kitty` terminal
  - `keepassxc`
  - `mpv`, which has a pseudo-gui
  - `firefox`, `chromium`
  - `inkscape`, `gimp`
  - `qgis`
- and without using `apt`, I would install
  - "Google Chrome"
    - if Chromium isn't enough
    - download the deb pkg and double click it
  - "VS Code"
    - I've been using "Code - OSS" from github at home
    - the executable is `code` either way
  - `nvm` for npm, npx, node, etc
    - get latest from github
  - `nvim`
    - get latest from github
  - `php` and `composer`
    - follow Laravel install instructions

FYI: Mint includes these but Debian might not:

- `man-db`
- `bash-completion`
- `command-not-found` (to suggest missing pkgs)
- `build-essential` (for gcc, etc)
- `file`, `less`, `xxd`
- `curl`, `wget`
- `openssh-client`, `openssl`
- `procps` (for pkill, prgrep)
- `net-tools` (for netstat)
- `rsync`
- `logrotate`
- `vim`
- `zip`, `unzip`, `zstd`
- `tmux`
  - to multiplex, which is handy on a headless system
  - to disconnect and resume a session

## After Install

- Set up Timeshift snapshots
  - I include home dotfiles, exclude `/root/**`
  - A good list of other exclusions apply by default. Click "Filter - Summary" to view.
- Cinnamon Settings
  - Scrolling on Title bar can be set to adjust window opacity
  - Use "Software Sources - Mirrors" and wait for some speed measurements to finish
  - Set Caps to Escape in Keyboard - Layout
  - I Changed move/resize key from Alt to Super
- Confirm that printing just works by joining a new network with a printer
  - Print a test page from the printer settings
- Find Ulauncher settings
  - Change the hotkey to be more unique
  - I think the default was Ctrl-Space, which IDEs tend to use
- Run the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW)
  - I set it to deny all incoming connections
  - This is easy enough to configure later
- Verify that `fstrim.timer` is running, which is good for SSD longevity
  - `systemctl status fstrim.timer`
- Remove asterisks from password prompts
  - normally I expect CLI password prompts to not echo anything
  - do this by removing the file `/etc/sudoers.d/0pwfeedback`
    - I renamed it: `sudo mv /etc/sudoers.d/0pwfeedback{,.bak}`
- SSH
  - I make an `ssh-list` alias to remind me of connections that I might want to use
  - I make other `ssh-*` aliases for these connections
  - Consider creating keys like this:
    - `ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "for XYZ server" -f ~/.ssh/xyz_rsa`
    - A strong RSA variant will be used by default
  - Copy public keys with `ssh-copy-id`
  - _ASIDE_: Avoid SSH Agent if using more than a few keys
    - Too many keys can lead to a "too many attempts" error.
    - Think of this as a keyring with many keys, and some "locks" only offer a couple of tries.
    - Try using `ssh -i $key` or `scp -i $key`, which doesn't require the agent.
    - I do still want SSH Agent for Git Repo (Bitbucket, Azure Repo) keys
    - unless there's a way to configure git to use a specific key and not the agent
    - So to keep the "keyring" small, I only add keys for remote repos
    - On Ubuntu, any `.ssh/$x` with a corresponding `.ssh/$x.pub` file will be auto-added to the keyring
    - On other systems, I'd use [this script](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/wiki/Auto-launching-ssh-agent-when-git-starts)
      and replace "id_rsa" with whatever space-separated keys you need.
  - Verify that SSH login works and password login doesn't
- Make an XDG .local directory: `mkdir ~/.local`
  - some apps might put files in non-standard locations if this doesn't exist
  - add `$HOME/.local/bin` to your PATH; I set this in `~/.profile`
- Copy dotfiles from other system or repo
- For interactive CLI, consider oh-my-posh or oh-my-zsh
- Install some programming utils
  - see Packages above for more ideas
- Install at least one Nerd Font
  - these provide programming symbols and double-wide symbols
  - look up Nerd Fonts, look for downloads
  - install fonts with `fc-cache -fv`
    - use before downloading anything to see what dirs it's scanning (can omit `-f` option)
    - use after downloading and moving font files (can omit `-v` option)
- Install a neovim distro (like LazyVim) to get some nice default features and settings
  - I put the configs in `~/.config/lazyvim` instead of `~/.config/nvim`
  - then make an alias to use `NVIM_APPNAME=lazyvim nvim`

## Docker

To install docker, I followed these [apt repository instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository)
but with this substitution:

    # Replace this
    $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")
    # with this
    $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$UBUNTU_CODENAME")

On Mint 22, the value here should be "noble" and not "wilma."

    apt policy docker-ce
