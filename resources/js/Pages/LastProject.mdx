# Previous Project

For 7 years, I worked on a feature-rich, interactive web map.

It was a private, internal app, so I'll just describe it here.

## Web Map

Having worked on this longer than anyone else, I added or improved almost
every feature:

- Home page with Login and list of Projects
- Each project is a **Leaflet** map
  - for collaborative editing of most features
  - Some maps have OSP Fiber management features:
    - **Splicing UI** for fiber strands
    - **Signal Tracing**
    - **Splice Sheet** exports
    - Address and Terminal **imports**
  - that gets map tiles from **GeoServer**
  - gets data from **PostgreSQL**, **PostGIS**
  - provides feature snapping options
  - keyboard shortcuts
  - layer group toggles
  - layer selection preferences
  - Address Search, and Reverse Geocode (what address is here)
  - Street View
  - attributes for selected features in a Table
  - multiple edits via Table
  - related data and images
  - attribute search and filter
  - zoom to feature
  - encode view extents in URL fragment
  - share feature URL
- Hosted on **Azure** with **nginx**, and **docker-compose**
- Performance improvements with
  - Redis cache
  - connection pooling
  - load balancing Geoserver instances with **nginx**
  - batching large selections
  - improving slow functions
- An **API** to support
  - a mobile client
  - some map features
- Notifications to announce new features
