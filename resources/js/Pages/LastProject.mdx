# Previous Project

For 7 years, I worked on a feature-rich, interactive web map.

## Web Map

Having worked on this longer than anyone else, I added or improved almost
every feature:

- Home page with Login and list of Projects
  - Each Project has an interactive map for a certain internal group
  - Notifications to announce new features
- Each map is a **Leaflet** map that
  - gets map tiles from **GeoServer**
  - gets data from **PostgreSQL**, **PostGIS**
  - allows **collaborative editing** of most features
  - provides feature **snapping** options
  - keyboard shortcuts
  - toggles layer groups
  - remembers layer selections
  - has Address Search, and Reverse Geocode (what address is here)
  - shows Street View
  - shows attributes for selected features in a Table
  - allows **multiple edits** via Table
  - shows related data and images
  - attribute search and filter
  - zoom to feature
  - encode view extents in URL fragment
  - share feature URL
- Performance improvements with
  - caching with Redis
  - connection pooling
  - load balancing Geoserver instances with nginx
  - batching large selections
  - improving slow functions
- Some maps have OSP Fiber management features:
  - **Splicing UI** for fiber strands
  - **Signal Tracing**
  - **Splice Sheet** exports
  - Address and Terminal imports
- An **API** to support
  - some map features
  - a mobile client
- Caching with Redis
- Hosted on Azure with nginx, and docker-compose
